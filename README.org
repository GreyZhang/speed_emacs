* speed emacs
** After I got used to emacs , I found all the popular emacs configurations work slow on Windows. Yet Windows is my main work platform, so I want to find a set of useful packages which is still fast on Windows.
** How to install
- 1. backup your .emacs.d
- 2. git clone https://github.com/GreyZhang/speed_emacs ~/.emacs.d
- 3. run you emacs and wait for installation  compelete.
** Package list:
*** emacs
- This is not a package, but emacs itself.
 I add this beacause there are still some configuration just for pure emacs.
- Better support for Chinese word format.
- explicitly set the prefered coding systems to avoid annoying prompt from emacs (especially on Microsoft Windows).
