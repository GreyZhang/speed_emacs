* speed emacs
** After I got used to emacs , I found all the popular emacs configurations work slow on Windows. Yet Windows is my main work platform, so I want to find a set of useful packages which is still fast on Windows.
** How to instll
- 1. backup your .emacs.d
- 2. git clone https://github.com/GreyZhang/speed_emacs ~/.emacs.d

** Package list:
*** emacs
- This is not a package, but emacs itself.
 I add this beacause there are still some configuration just for pure emacs.
